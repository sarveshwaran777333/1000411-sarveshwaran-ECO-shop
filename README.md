# ShopImpact: Conscious Shopping Dashboard
Transforming everyday shopping into a mindful, eco-conscious experience.

# Project Overview
ShopImpact is an interactive web application designed for ShopImpact Ltd. to help users visualize the hidden environmental costs of their purchases. By logging planned buys, the app calculates an estimated CO₂ footprint and nudges users toward sustainable habits through rewards and ethical alternatives.

# User Focus
1. Target Audience: Young adults, students, and eco-conscious families.
2. Problem Solved: Bridges the gap between purchasing and environmental awareness by making carbon footprints visible.
3. Design Philosophy: Uses a "Design Thinking" approach to create empowerment rather than guilt.

# Key Features
As per the project brief, this application integrates the following:
1. Real-time CO₂ Calculation: Uses curated multipliers to estimate the environmental cost (Price × Multiplier).
2. Live Dashboard: A monthly summary of total spending and carbon impact.
3. Eco-Badges: Automated rewards like "Eco Saver" or "Low Impact Shopper" based on user choices.
4. Ethical Suggestions: Provides a list of greener brand alternatives for different product types.
5. Turtle Graphics: (Ensure this is in your code) Displays visual "leaves" or "eco-badges" using Python’s Turtle library when positive choices are made.
6. Random Eco-Tips: Motivational quotes and facts about sustainable living (e.g., benefits of bamboo).

# Integration & Logic
1. Core Constructs: The app utilizes Python lists and dictionaries to store purchase history and product impact multipliers.
2. Modular Design: Built with specific functions for impact calculation and UI rendering to ensure clean, maintainable code.
3. UI/UX: Developed in Streamlit using an earthy color palette (greens, beiges) and a clear visual hierarchy for elderly and tech-savvy users alike.
